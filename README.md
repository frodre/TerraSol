# TerraSol

TerraSol is a small interactive application letting users design a simple
star-planet system and to simulate rudimentary aspects of the planet's
habitability.

You can use the simulation at https://terrasol.herokuapp.com

Please get in touch if  you have any suggestions or interesting ways you use this
in the classroom!

## Running TerraSol

This application needs Python 3.x with the packages, bokeh, numpy,
scipy, pandas, and xarray installed. After cloning/downloading the files,
navigate to the parent directory of TerraSol start the bokeh
server with:

    bokeh serve --show TerraSol

This will start a bokeh server with the application and open it in
a window of your system's default browser.
