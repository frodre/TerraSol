# TerraSol

TerraSol is a small interactive application letting users design a simple
star-planet system and to simulate rudimentary aspects of the planet's
climate.

## Running TerraSol

This application needs Python 3.x with the packages, bokeh and numpy installed.
After cloning/downloading the files, navigate to the src location and
start the bokeh server with:

    bokeh serve --show TerraSol.py

This will start a bokeh server with the application and open it in
a window of your system's default browser.
